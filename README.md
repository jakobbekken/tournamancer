# 🏆 Tournamancer 🧙‍♂️

Effortlessly manage and organize tournaments for tabletop games!

## About the project

This will be a project aiming to help create tournaments, arrange them, and post the results afterwards. It will be created to be used by the tabletop student organisation TADA! at UiA Grimstad, so the focus will be in creating features or different tabletop games.

The goal is to make it useable for anyone to set up a tournament and join them. It needs to be stable, have presets for different types of games and tournament styles, be user friendly and consistent.
